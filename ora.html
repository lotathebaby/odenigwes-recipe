           <h4>Ingredients</h4>
           <ul>
            <li>Oha leaves</li>
            <li>8 small corms of cocoyam</li>
            <li>3 cooking spoons of red oil</li>            
            <li>Assorted beef</li>
            <li>Assorted fish</li>
            <li>Chilli pepper</li>
            <li>salt</li>
            <li>crayfish</li>
            <li>2 stock cubes</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Ogiri Igbo</li>
           </ul>
           <h4>Cooking Methods</h4>
           <ul>
           <li>Grind the crayfish and pepper and set aside</li> 
            <li>Wash and boil the cocoyam corms till soft. Remove the peels and use a mortar and pestle to pound the corms to a smooth paste.</li>
            <li>Using your fingers, cut the Ora (Oha) leaves into tiny pieces. This technique is to prevent the vegetable from becoming darker in colour. This happens when you cut the ora leaves with a knife.</li>
            <li>Boil the shaki (cow tripe), stock fish and dry fish in 1 litre of water till they are well done. First sign of a done shaki is that the cuts will start curling on itself.</li>
            <li>Wash the beef and add to the pot of shaki etc. and continue cooking.</li>
            <li>When the meat is done, add 2 stock cubes and cook for 5 minutes.
                Add the pepper, ogiri Igbo and ground crayfish and cook for 10 minutes. Add the cocoyam paste in small lumps and then the palm oil.</li>
            <li>Cover the pot and leave to cook on high heat till all the cocoyam lumps have dissolved. You can add more water if you feel that the soup is too thick.</li>
            <li>Add the ora (oha) leaves and leave to cook for about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add salt to taste, stir and the soup is ready!</li> 
           </ul>
