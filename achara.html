            <img src="https://www.allnigerianrecipes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/ofe-achara.jpg" alt="achara soup"> 
           <h4>Ingredients</h4>
           <ul>
            <li>300g egusi (melon) seeds</li>
            <li>40g osu</li>
            <li>1 handful sliced okazi leaves</li>
            <li>2 cooking sppons red palm oil</li>
            <li>1 cup broken pieces of achara</li>
            <li>3 pieces stock fish</li>
            <li>1 dry cat fish</li>
            <li>1 ogiri okpei</li>
            <li>3 small stock cubes</li>
            <li>Habanero pepper</li>
            <li>1 handful crayfish</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dry pepper</li>
            <li>Salt (to taste)</li>
           </ul>
           <h4>Cooking Directions</h4>
           <ul>
            <li>Cook the stockfish with the stock cubes (seasoning cubes) till soft and pour some of the stock into a bowl. Yes, this has been soaked earlier but stockfish is quite tough and soaking alone does not get it as soft as we need it. The soaking is necessary so that it can be cleaned very well.</li>
            <li>Pour most of the ground egusi (about 70%) into a clean dry bowl.</li>
            <li>Season the egusi with dry pepper and some of the crayfish and ogiri okpei blend. It's important to season the egusi very well so that the mgbam will not taste bland when one bites into it.</li>
            <li>Add some of the fish stock to the egusi and mix till a thick dough is formed</li>
            <li>Mold the egusi dough into flat discs, as big as a coin and set aside.</li>
            <li>Boil some water and throw the molded egusi into the pot of boiling water. Cook for 10 minutes on medium heat.</li>
            <li>Set the pot of stockfish on the stove. It should still contain some stock from cooking the stockfish. If not, add the water from boiling the egusi balls.</li>
            <li>Add the deboned dry fish, habanero pepper and the remaining crayfish and ogiri okpei blend and bring to a boil.</li>
            <li>Once it boils, take off the fish and set aside.</li>
            <li>Add the remaining ground egusi to the stock, stir and cook till you see some clear egusi oil come to the surface. This should take 15 to 20 minutes. Stir the soup often so it does not burn. Add the water you used in boiling the molded egusi when necessary.</li>
            <li>Once you are sure you see some clear oil at the top, add palm oil and cook for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the boiled akpuruakpu egusi, achara, okazi and the fish we took out earlier.</li>
            <li>Add salt to your taste, cover and once it boils again, it is done!</li>
        </ul>
